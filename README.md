# Project: Escape the Block

**Description:**
Escape the Block is a project I completed during my second year as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course using Java. The gameplay involves using the mouse to control a circle and navigate it to avoid various obstacles.

**Learning Outcomes:**
Through this project, I learned various OOP concepts and their practical applications. This includes understanding how to design and implement classes, manage object interactions, and apply inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in a real-world scenario.
